    "\n",
    "Now that we know basics of `python`, we will introduce `pathpy`, a network analysis and visualisation package that is developed at my chair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to many other packages, `pathpy` has a couple of advantages. First, it is easy to install as should have no dependencies not included in a default `anaconda` installation. Seond, `pathpy` has a user-friendly API that makes it easy to handle directed and undirected networks, networks with single and multiple edges, multi-layer networks or temporal networks. It also provides interactive HTML visualisations that can be directly displayed inside `jupyter` notebooks, which makes it particularly suitable for educational settings. Third, it supports the analysis and visualisation of time series data on networked systems, such as time-stamped edges or data on paths in networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first import `pathpy` and assign the local alias `pp`:"

The topology of a matrix is represented in terms of a matrix A, where an entry A[i,j]=1 indicates that an edge exists from the i-th to the j-th node of the network. The absendce of edges is encoded by zero entries. The size of an adjacency matrix representation of a network with n nodes is generally $n^2$, which is not suitable for networks with thousands or millions of nodes. `pathpy` nevertheless supports efficient adjacency matrix calculation for *sparse* networks, i.e. networks where the majority of node pairs are not connected by an edge. Instead of a fully populated matrix, a call to `Network.adjacency_matrix()` returns a *sparse matrix object*, i.e. an efficient representation of the indices and values of non-zero entries:"
